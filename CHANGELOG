 * Update URL in installation instructions.
 * Properly format the carrier_accounts parameter in create shipment requests.
   Prior to this change, specifying a carrier account would result in a failed
   request. This removes the undocumented parameter from the CreateShipment and
   CreateShipmentWithContext methods, and adds a CarrierAccountIDs field to
   the Shipment struct type.
 * Add proper struct tag to CarrierAccount.Fields so that it has the proper
   key name when serialized to JSON. Prior to this change, values in the Fields
   field were not recognized by the API.
