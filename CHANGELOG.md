## v2.0.0 (2022-02-09)

**NOTE: Do not use this release, use v2.0.1 or later due to this release being incorrectly packaged.**

- Bumps minimum Go version from `1.12` to `1.15`
- Bumps dependencies
- Lints the entire project
- adds a `client.RetrieveMe()` function to retrieve the authenticated user
- Adds support to one-call buy an order by passing a `Service` and `CarrierAccount`
- Adds support to update user brand via `client.UpdateBrand()`
- Adds support to create a list of trackers via `client.CreateTrackerList()`
- Adds support for getting the lowest rate of a shipment via `client.LowestRate()`
- Adds support to rerate a shipment via the `client.RerateShipment()` method
- Adds a default timeout of 60 seconds to requests. This can be overridden by setting the `Client.Timeout` option in milliseconds
- Fixed a spelling error for `origin_location` on the Tracker struct
- Removed `GetShipmentRates()` and `GetShipmentRatesWithContext()` methods since the shipment struct already has rates. If you need to get new rates for a shipment, please use the `RerateShipment()` method instead
- Adds a `SmartRate` struct since the structure of the `Rate` and `SmartRate` objects are different (previously the SmartRate object borrowed the Rate struct)

## v1.4.0 (2021-10-06)

- Adds support for `TaxIdentifiers`
- Remove experimental undocumented methods `ListTrackersUpdated` and `ListTrackersUpdatedWithContext`

## v1.3.1 (2021-06-23)

- Corrects `CODAmount` from a `float64` to a `string`

## v1.3.0 (2021-05-27)

- Adds `Smartrate` functionality to the `Shipments` object (available by calling `GetShipmentSmartrates()`)

## v1.2.0 (2021-04-06)

- Fix batch scan form functionality; replace GetBatchScanForms with
  CreateBatchScanForms

## v1.1.0 (2020-06-10)

- Update example code.
- Add GetRate method and example.
- Remove ListCustomsInfos, ListCustomsItems, ListOrders and ListPickups
  methods.
- Add GetEvent, ListEvents and ListEventPayloads methods. Add example code
  for using these methods as well as using the Event type in a webhook
  handler.

## v1.0.3 (2020-05-30)

- Fix issue in List actions that take query parameters

## v1.0.2 (2020-05-08)

- Add shipment options for certified and registered mail.
- Changes to unit tests.

## v1.0.1 (2020-03-17)

- Update URL in installation instructions.
- Properly format the carrier_accounts parameter in create shipment requests.
  Prior to this change, specifying a carrier account would result in a failed
  request. This removes the undocumented parameter from the CreateShipment and
  CreateShipmentWithContext methods, and adds a CarrierAccountIDs field to
  the Shipment struct type.
- Add proper struct tag to CarrierAccount.Fields so that it has the proper
  key name when serialized to JSON. Prior to this change, values in the Fields
  field were not recognized by the API.

## v1.0.0 (2019-09-03)

- Initial release.
